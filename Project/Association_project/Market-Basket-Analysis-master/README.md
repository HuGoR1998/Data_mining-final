# Market Basket Analysis in Python

Market basket analysis is the study of items that are likely to be purchased together. Its aim is to discover groups of items that are frequently purchased together so that stores or e-commerce websites can better organize their layouts. This is usually done so that complimentary items that belong to one group are placed together in the store. 

In this 3-hour workshop, you will study the historical data of customer purchases for a clothing store in order to group frequently purchased items together. You will use the Python data science ecosystem to wrangle, analyze and visualize the data. Finally, you will build a machine learning model to perform market basket analysis!
